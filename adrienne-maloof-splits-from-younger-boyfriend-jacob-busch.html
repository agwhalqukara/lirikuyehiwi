The former Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star, 53, has split from her much-younger beau of a year-and-a-half, 25, sources confirm to <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong>.</p><p>According to TMZ, which first reported the breakup, the relationship started to fizzle out last fall. Around that time, Maloof returned to RHOBH in a couple of cameos on the current season, bringing Busch along as her date. (She left the show after three seasons in 2013 but came back to "mend" some "unfinished situations," as she told Us last summer.)</p><p>Maloof and Busch first stepped out together back in October 2013, when they were spotted making out at an event in Hollywood. Days after that sighting, the reality TV veteran spoke to Extra about their romance, calling him a "lovely person."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"Both of our families have been in the spirits business for a long time, so he seems very familiar to me and comfortable," she said at the time. "He's a cool guy."</p><p>Prior to hooking up with Busch, Maloof briefly dated <strong>Sean Stewart</strong>, rocker <strong>Rod Stewart</strong>'s 34-year-old son. And as RHOBH fans know, she was married for 10 years to plastic surgeon <strong>Dr. Paul Nassif</strong> (now a star of E!'s Botched), with whom she has three sons. They split acrimoniously in 2012.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJidqpmau6%2BxjKaYpaefm3q0vMuiq6xllqe8rnnYqKynn5WneqO72J%2Bpop2emXqrrcKomWaapaiwqXmRaWhuaWZm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
