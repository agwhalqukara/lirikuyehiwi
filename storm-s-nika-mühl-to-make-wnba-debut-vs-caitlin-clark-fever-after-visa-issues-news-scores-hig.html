In her two seasons as a regular starter at UConn, she averaged 7.0 points on 43.8 percent shooting along with 7.2 assists per game.</p><p>Seattle could desperately use Mühl's playmaking ability with the backcourt combo of Jewell Loyd and Skylar Diggins-Smith still learning how to play off one another out of the gate.</p><p>The Storm are last in assists (14.8 per game), 10th in turnovers (19.8) and last in <a href=# rel=noopener>assist rate</a> (52.7 percent), according to WNBA.com. As much as Loyd and Diggins-Smith should be empowered to freelance and create their own shots, the offense has been far too isolation-heavy.</p><p>The fact that Loyd and Diggins-Smith have combined to shoot 28.1 percent from the floor has only exacerbated the problem.</p><p>Mühl will presumably come off the bench against the Fever given the time she has been out, and that's where her role could stay once Quinn settles on a regular rotation.</p><p>But having a true facilitator who isn't looking to score at a high volume will go some way toward ironing out Seattle's offensive woes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmd%2Fdn6MrKuoqp2oeq%2B1yppkpq2YoXq1u4ymmKSdXay7o62MnZybraRiw7R5wpqgraSZo3qkuMCromaelauys3nAn6ueql2rtrStjKKqrK2VqA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
