Some renowned celebrities became successful even without going to college, while others went to university and graduated with flying colors. So, which of the two categories does award-winning actress <a href=#>Reese Witherspoon</a> fall under?</p><p><strong>Reese Witherspoon briefly attended Stanford University but left without completing her English Literature degree to pursue her acting career.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebanswers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Did-Reese-Witherspoon-Go-To-College-__-Reese-Witherspoon-Tinseltown-683x1024.jpg><p>However, not finishing college didn’t stop Reese from being the achiever she always has been. “Little Miss Type A,” as she was fondly called when she was young, has accomplished so much over the years. Let’s look at some of her most significant achievements.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Early Education</h2><p>Oscar-winning actress Reese Witherspoon has charmed her audience with her extraordinary aptitude for playing notable roles in movies.</p><p>At 15, she made her<a href=# rel=noopener> big-screen debut when</a> she starred in the movie<a href=# rel=noopener> The Man In The Moon</a>. However, her biggest break didn’t come until the<a href=# rel=noopener> early 2000s</a>, when she played the beautiful and iconic Elle Woods in the film<a href=# rel=noopener> Legally Blonde</a>. After the movie’s release, she became even more widely known, starred in more projects and received numerous awards as a renowned Hollywood actress.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Born on<a href=# rel=noopener> March 22, 1976, in New Orleans, Louisiana</a>, to John Draper Witherspoon and Betty Witherspoon, Reese had gotten her desire to act when she appeared on television at seven. However, she remained focused on her studies and earned good grades throughout her days at Harpeth Hall School, a private all-girls school from which she graduated in 1994.</p><p>Reese then attended Stanford University after high school, majoring in English Literature. After completing her first year in college, though, she decided to put her studies on hold to pursue her love for acting.</p><p>This act inevitably upset her parents, and<a href=# rel=noopener> she shared an interview with Ellen DeGeneres</a>:</p><p>“Oh, my mom was so mad at me that I dropped out of college because she wanted me to be a doctor, specifically a plastic surgeon. My dad was an ear, nose, and throat surgeon, but my mom was just really determined for me to be a plastic surgeon.”</p><p>Reese continued, “She was mad about it for probably ten years. And then I bought her a house, so she got over it. At some point, it turned into a better deal for Betty.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Acting Awards</h2><p>Known for her excellent acting skills, Reese Witherspoon has received numerous awards throughout the past decades.
