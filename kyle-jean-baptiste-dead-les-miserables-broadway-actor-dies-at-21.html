Broadway star <strong>Kyle Jean-Baptiste</strong> died at the age of 21 on Friday, Aug. 28, the <a href=#>Hollywood Reporter</a> confirms. He passed away after falling from his mother’s fire escape.</p><p>Jean-Baptiste was best known for becoming the youngest actor and the first African American to play Jean Valjean in the stage production of Les Miserables.</p><p>“The entire LES MISERABLES family is shocked and devastated by the sudden and tragic loss of Kyle, a remarkable young talent and tremendous person who made magic – and history – in his Broadway debut,” Broadway World said in a statement Saturday. “We send our deepest condolences to his family and ask that you respect their privacy in this unimaginably difficult time."</p><p>The 6-foot-2 tenor was an understudy for the Jean Valjean role, which was played by <strong>Hugh Jackman</strong> in the 2012 film adaptation. He had his first show on July 23, and tweeted about his last performance on Aug. 25.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Thursday is my last Valjean on broadway. The ability to play this part on Broadway has been life changing. I'm so greatful. @LesMizBway,” he wrote at the time. “I thank everyone who supported me and still does. I will never forget this experience. Onwards and upwards ;). Nothing but love.”</p><p>Shortly after the news broke, stars paid their respects to the late star via Twitter. “RIP Kyle Jean-Baptiste. My love and hugs to his family. And the cast of @LesMiserables,” Broadway veteran <strong>Kristin Chenoweth</strong> wrote. <strong>Josh Groban</strong> added: “He was just getting started. So sad. My condolences as well to family and cast.”</p><p>The tragedy also hit home for<strong> Ansel Elgort</strong>, who grew up with Jean-Baptiste. “I played opposite Kyle Jean-Baptiste in hairspray in high school at Laguardia,” the Insurgent actor tweeted. “What I remember most above his talent was his warmth.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKKypJVit6atzWaZmqiknsC1sYydnJqcXaGytHnMoqqeqpGXuaa%2FjJupqJmUrK66ecCcq6iqXZm2pr%2BMmqtmamFif3F9lGtwcQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
