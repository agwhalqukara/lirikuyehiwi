She let her followers know the Disney Channel film, Descendants inspired her daughter’s new hairstyle.</p><p>It didn’t take long for the mom shamers to come out in droves. Simpson was bashed in the comments section for dying the young girl’s hair. Several remarks stated Maxwell was too young, as well as the hairstyle made her look so much older than her age.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B0kAmYTAVmP/?utm_source=ig_embed</p><p>“Isn’t she too young to have her hair dyed?” wrote olgalilia</p><p>“Don’t like it at all!!! Much better before the color. The new color make her look older than her age,” replied cseamanis</p><p>“OMG!! Too young to start damaging her hair,” stated ksh329</p><p>The trolls became too much for Pink, who has endured her own fair share of being mom-shamed. She decided to rally behind Simpson by letting her 8-year-old daughter Willow dye her hair blue.</p><p>“I heard people were bummed on Jessica Simpson for letting her seven-year-old get her hair colored. So, we thought we’d share what we did yesterday,” Pink captioned the picture.</p><p>Not only did she show support for Simpson but Pink also turned off her comments section to block the trolls from coming at her. Pink even used the hashtag “oh look no comments.”</p><p>Pink may have shut off her comments section, but that didn’t stop fans from praising her on Simpson’s original Instagram post. Fans were quick to let Simpson know what Pink did in solidarity with her.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B0pOBsAg3u-/</p><p>Jessica Simpson has not responded to all the comments mom-shaming her for dying Maxwell’s hair. She is used to being criticized and rarely acknowledges the haters.</p><p>Pink, however, decided to take matters into her own hands. She let fans know she stands with Simpson by dying her own child’s hair. It was a gesture fitting Pink’s I don’t give a crap attitude.</p><p>Although it is kind of an odd thing to bond over, it is not about dying hair, it is about moms supporting moms. Recently the ‘So What’ singer came under fire for letting Willow and her 2-year-old son Jameson run around at the Holocaust Memorial.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Honestly, most of Pink’s parenting moves cause Pink to get trolled but <a href=#>she still keeps on doing her thing</a>. It is just another reason fans love the singer.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGegnrusedGao6Whlah6o7HHoqWdZZqawLS1wppkrKGdpcCwuoyana2domLBs7vLpapmpZ%2BierS0wKacZqCVp3qnu9Fmm7Khnpx6pa3UoJ%2BtnaKoeqmtyKtkbGhoZYB4ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
