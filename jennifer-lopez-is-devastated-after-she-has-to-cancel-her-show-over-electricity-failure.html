Lopez had to stop her show at the Madison Square Garden on Saturday night because of the unexpected loss of power.</p><p>Approximately thirty minutes into her second performance at Madison Square Garden for her latest tour, “It’s My Party,” emergency background lights flicked on and attendees were told to evacuate the venue.</p><p>The star went on her Instagram not long after to say she was heartbroken over having to stop her show. Moreover, the legendary singer stated she would do everything she could to make it up to her legion of fans. “Heartbroken to say tonight’s show is canceled. We will reschedule. Love you all!!” the singer-songwriter wrote.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz4RNVNgnO7/</p><p>Today claims the blackout affected much of the Midtown and Upper West Side neighborhoods in New York City, leaving close to 72,000 New Yorkers power-less. The loss of power also led to the shutdown of the Times Square billboards, the Broadway shows, as well as the subway stations.</p><p>J-Lo assured her fans she would come back and they’d definitely get their money’s worth. Other big names in the entertainment industry were quick to praise J-Lo’s decisiveness when addressing the issue – which was completely out of her control.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz4ns-dAw1t/</p><p>The COO of A-Rod Corporation, Jeff Lee, took to his social media account to say it was “moments like these that separate icons from the rest.” Lopez will continue her scheduled performances for the remainder of the summer, taking one night off to celebrate her birthday, and then going on to perform in three more major cities in North America.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>This comes not long after J-Lo gave the World Cup winner, Carli Lloyd, a lap-dance following the Women’s US soccer team taking home the gold at the World Cup last week. Jennifer was captured on video swirling around Lloyd with Lopez’s dancers performing in the background.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeamruvtcWeqWakn6Wyu3nIrGSdnaaWwLWt056bZpmWqbKzedKhnGagkah6tbuMnJinm5Wheqmx0WaqoaenYry3sdFmnKWdk6m%2Fqq%2FIrbBmnpGeuba%2BxGZqaWplZYBw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
