It has to be said that throughout the film both Robert and Dartanian worked wonderfully with the very graphic and adult content they had written for them; yet it provided another feature of the film that felt quite disjointed, the amount of&nbsp;physical and verbally abusive scenes got to the point where they lost their shock value and simply became uncomfortable to watch.</p><p>But, with this family comes a sub-plot of martial and child abuse that caused Courtney to take her kids away from the overpowering presence of their father Clint (Lea Coco). It provided a clever excuse for both of the children’s strange behaviour, so much so that the mother never questioned what her children were really seeing until it was too late.</p><p>However, the sloppy aspects of the film stemmed from its comedic dialogue, particularly from the mouth of our Ex-Deputy (James Ransone)- although I have a feeling he was only there to serve as comic relief, given his like-ability. The deaths in this film were far more gruesome and elaborate; but slightly inconceivable for a child to commit. It was clear that director, Ciaran Foy was going for dramatic, face-squirming, have-to-look-away-you’re-that-disgusted deaths, so&nbsp;in that respect he succeeded.</p><p>What should have felt like a natural extension of Sinister, a continuation of all its effective scares and devices, sadly felt more like a amateur’s attempt at&nbsp;it&nbsp;that relied&nbsp;repulsing the audience because they couldn’t scare us with what they had produced.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kv6bCyJ6uZquZo7a0wMSrZGtn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
