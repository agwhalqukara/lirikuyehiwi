The View’s official social media website paid homage to her by uploading a photo and writing that they were fortunate to have Walters as their creator, coworker, and friend. The article continued:</p><p>“She was a pioneering television figure that cracked numerous glass ceilings as a woman in the profession, including founding ‘The View’ in 1997 to support women’s perspectives. We are honored to be a part of her legacy. She will be remembered and missed for the rest of her life.”</p><p>CNN presenter Don Lemon also expressed his sorrow, noting that Walters was a great television personality. Lemon also said that he enjoyed spending time in person with Walters and that sitting next to her and hearing her at a dinner party was one of his favorite memories with The View co-host. He finished by writing:</p><p>“I was awestruck by her. Barbara Walters, rest in peace, with respect and adoration.”</p><p>Cindi Berger, the late journalist’s publicist, said that Barbara Walters died calmly at her home, surrounded by family members.</p><h2>Barbara Walters has dementia, as well as a few other health difficulties.</h2><p>Barbara was said to be suffering from dementia after retiring as a journalist. Her health has deteriorated in recent years, despite the fact that she has never mentioned her health problems to her admirers and following. According to RadarOnline, she never left her bed and had difficulty recognizing her pals. According to the source, she was experiencing tiredness, lethargy, anxiety, and agitation.&nbsp;Aside from that, Barbara had aortic valve stenosis and a defective aortic valve, both of which required surgery in 2010. The issue was resolved, and her spokesperson disclosed a few days later that the operation went well and that she was well.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Barbara-Walters-1.jpg alt="Barbara Walters" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>When Whoopi Goldberg mentioned her on The View four months ago, her followers were concerned about her health. Although Goldberg made no mention of Barbara’s health, the latter’s fewer public appearances heightened the public worry.</p><h2>Barbara Walters was highly recognized for her work with ABC.</h2><p>Barbara Walters first appeared on NBC’s The Today Show in 1961 and later became a co-host in 1974. She quickly joined ABC and spent two years as the co-anchor of ABC Evening News. In 1979, she became the presenter of ABC’s 20/20.
