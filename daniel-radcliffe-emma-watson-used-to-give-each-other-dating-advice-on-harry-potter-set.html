This is a nightmare’.”</p><p><strong>Emma </strong>added that their relationship was much like Harry and Hermione’s with an “older brother, younger sister thing.”</p><p><strong>Rupert Grint</strong>, who played Ron Weasley, did joke there were “a lot of hormones flying around [on set]“.</p><p>Neville Longbottom starrer <strong>Matthew Lewis</strong> said that it was much like real school and there “were crushes and people went out with each other and broke up, just like we used to do in school…It was exactly the same environment, but it was just in a Defense of the Dark Arts class.”</p><p><strong>Daniel </strong>went on, saying that Goblet of Fire “is probably peak hormone, at least for me. It was exactly like you’d expect, especially since the fourth film had a bunch of hormonal teenagers anyway and bringing two massive groups of new people, all of them purposefully hot for the film.”</p><p>“That film, yeah, it was all kicking off. [JK Rowling] wrote [Harry] very endearingly in those years and I felt it did not take a huge acting stretch for me to tap into my awkward nerdy teenage side.”</p><p>Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts reunion will premiere on Saturday, January 1 on HBO Max.
