Amidst the chaos that ensues, family members face a difficult choice between loyalty and standing up against Gazal’s manipulative schemes. Dua, however, emerges as a pillar of strength, actively defending her loved ones against Gazal’s cunning tactics.</p><p>Things take a dramatic turn when Gazal reveals her plot to use Ruhaan as a pawn against Dua, prompting Ajaz to consider leaving. However, Hafeez, still seething from a previous clash with Ajaz, steps in to confront him. Worried that Hafeez may have overheard her conversation, Gazal grows anxious. Hafeez seizes Ajaz, his anger unleashed as he blames him for ruining his sister’s life. Despite Gazal’s attempts to intervene, Hafeez’s fury towards Ajaz persists.</p><p>Gazal calls for assistance, hoping her family will come to her aid. To her surprise, Gulnaz witnesses the confrontation and approves of Hafeez’s actions. Hina rushes to the scene, intending to slap Hafeez, but Dua quickly intercepts the blow. Dua questions Hina’s audacity to raise a hand against her brother, emphasizing the importance of respect within the family. Although Hina tries to discredit Dua’s family, Dua refuses to engage, maintaining her composure and dignity.</p><p>Standing firmly by Dua’s side, her grandmother, Dadi, expresses her unwavering approval of Hafeez’s presence in the house. Hina challenges this decision, drawing a comparison to Gazal’s brother being allowed to stay. Confidently, Dua asserts her father’s instrumental role in bringing prosperity to the household, thereby justifying Hafeez’s right to reside there. With Dadi’s support reinforcing her stance, Dua leaves Gazal feeling isolated and exposed as the rest of the family departs from the scene.</p><p>Kaynaat attends to Hafeez’s wounds, offering apologies for Hina’s hurtful words. Hafeez brushes off the impact, likening Hina’s behavior to that of his own mother. They discuss the idea of revealing their relationship to the family, but Dua advises against it, considering Hina’s current animosity towards their family. Assuring them of a grand wedding in due time, Dua asks Ajaz to capture the moment on video, unaware of his ulterior motives.</p><p>Recognizing the importance of Ruhaan speaking up about the incident involving Haider, Dua stresses the need for patience. She urges Hafeez to exercise caution in sharing information until the appropriate time arrives.</p><p>In a lighter moment in the lounge, Hina playfully taunts Dua, insisting that she takes on the responsibility of cooking. Gazal suggests ordering food, but Hina objects due to her allergies. Dadi interrupts, expressing discomfort with ordered meals and requests an enema. Gazal, although unfamiliar with the procedure, pretends to be an expert to satisfy Dadi’s request. Dua finds the situation ironic, while Hina continues to make playful jibes about Gazal’s growing influence and Dua’s changing role in the household.</p><p>Also Read: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Rabb Se Hai Dua Written Updates: Gazal decided to keep the truth hidden</a></p><p>Dua emerges as a beacon of strength, actively defending her loved ones against Gazal’s manipulations.
