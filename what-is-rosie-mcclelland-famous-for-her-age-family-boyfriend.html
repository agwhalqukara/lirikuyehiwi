It follows two roommates who’ve launched a baby-sitting business, and the series won three of its 10 award nominations.</p><p>Rosie fell <a rel=nofollow href=#>in love with acting</a> following this first performance, and was then in 2014 cast to star in the family adventure comedy movie “Sophia Grace & Rosie’s Royal Adventure”, which also starred Margaret Clunie and Sophie Grace, and was directed by Brian Levant; it follows Rosie and her best friend Sophia as they’ve been sent to Switzelvania by “The Ellen DeGeneres Show”.</p><p>Rosie’s only other acting credit has been voicing both Grace and Georgie in three episodes of the 2019 short animated comedy series “The JoJo & BowBow Show Show”, which starred Nia Sioux, Case Walker and JoJo Siwa, and follows the adventures of JoJo Siwa and her pet dog; the series was nominated for a 2020 Young Entertainer Award for Best Young Actress – Voice Over Role for Giselle Lomelino.</p><p>Rosie hasn’t had any roles since then, focusing on her education.
