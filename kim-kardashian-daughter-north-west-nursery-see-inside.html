Mom <a href=#><strong>Kris Jenner</strong></a> and sisters <a href=#><strong>Kourtney</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Khloe Kardashian</strong></a> went into a frenzy after Kim headed to the hospital to finish North’s nursery in time! In a sneak peek from the Sunday, Oct. 27 episode of E!’s Keeping Up With the Kardashians, Jenner makes her best effort to work as efficiently as possible preparing the all-white room, but the space falls far short of Kourtney’s expectations.</p><p>“If you walked home and you were coming in here with the baby, would you want to want to go ‘Oh, look at this steamer . . . look at this table in the middle of the room,'” Kourtney tells her mother, pointing out the work-in-progress room’s flaws. “You’re putting the changing table right under the air conditioning?!”</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=346 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="kim kardashian nursery" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Agitated, Jenner — who invited Kim, her future son-in-law and granddaughter to live in her Calabasas, Calif. mansion — implores Kourtney to lend a hand instead of lending criticism. “Then move it!” she snaps, before Kourtney calls North’s nursery “despicable.” “We didn’t even have a changing table until 8 o’clock last night,” Jenner explains. This crib appeared in the middle of the room. It was me who had that bed you’re sitting on delivered yesterday. And I found these lucite tables . . . You guys are crazy.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Despite the mad dash to finalize North’s nursery, the impeccably designed space is warm and inviting — and entirely fit for Kim’s tiny princess.</p><p>Decked out in all-white with a $3,950 NurseryWorks Vetro Lucite crib and plush stuffed animals, the nursery — with a closet stocked with baby designer duds from Lanvin and Hermes — has proven to be a family hangout for the new parents and their bundle of joy. “Kanye, Kim and North always take naps together,” a Kardashian source tells <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a>. “The three of them cuddle and just hang out.”</p><p>Keeping Up With the Kardashians airs Sunday at 9 p.m. (EST) on E!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOpKCmZZuWv6Wt0qGgmqajYrGiwcahq56qXaO8s8DHZq6eq6RiwKaxjKKlrKGUmnqpsdFmmKWkXay1qsDEZqWuqqOav7p5kWlobGplZn0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
