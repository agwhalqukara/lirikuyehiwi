The Dolphins entered the day with roughly $35.7 million in salary-cap space.</p><p>The move creates a competition between Finnegan and second-year cornerbacks Jamar Taylor and Will Davis, with all three men vying&nbsp;<span>for the starting spot opposite Brent Grimes</span>.&nbsp;</p><p>Finnegan, 30, has started 99 regular-season games in his eight-year career and his name carries a lot of weight around the NFL<span>—</span>for reasons both good and bad<span>—</span>but his best days appear to be behind him.</p><p>He was voted a first-team All-Pro in 2008 with the <a href=#>Tennessee Titans</a>,&nbsp;when he notched five interceptions and helped the Titans defense rank second in scoring and ninth against the pass. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pro Football Focus</a><span>&nbsp;(subscription required) indicates that&nbsp;</span><span>he allowed completions on 58.3 percent of throws into his coverage and a passer rating of 61.6 that year</span><span>.</span></p><p>Since then, however, his play has dipped significantly.&nbsp;</p><p>He has allowed over 63 percent completions and an 80 passer rating in each of the past four years, including a 136.0 passer rating in 2013.&nbsp;Doug Farrar of Sports Illustrated adds another note:</p><p>More than his level of play, Finnegan is known around the league for his style of play—he doesn't mind ruffling some feathers during a game.</p><p>His most recent and most public altercation came in his last year with the Titans, when he and <a href=#>Houston Texans</a> wide receiver <a href=#>Andre Johnson</a> were both ejected from the game for ripping each other's helmets off and breaking into a full-blown fist fight.</p><p>Given his reputation, Finnegan is an interesting choice for a free-agent signing by a team trying to clean up its image after the incident with Jonathan Martin and Richie Incognito. Much like Incognito, Finnegan has been recognized around the league as one of the dirtiest players in the NFL, ranking sixth on this <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sports Illustrated&nbsp;player poll</a>.</p><p>In this instance, it appears the Dolphins have decided that the potential backlash of signing a player with Finnegan's background is worth the potential reward of his contributions on the field. That being said, we'll have to wait and see exactly what those contributions will be.</p><p>For now, the move doesn't address a position of dire need and Finnegan does not appear to have much left in the tank.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaHJxY2iDd3nDqKOpoJmjwG6%2FyKClZpufp8Gtrc2dZJ%2BhnqOyqK3NZp6rmZSeu6h506GcZqWfq7Jurc2dZLCgkal6qsCMppyapqNis7C%2BjKagmqWZ</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
