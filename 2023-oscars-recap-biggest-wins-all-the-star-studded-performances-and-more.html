If anyone in this theater commits an act of violence at any point during the show, you will be awarded the Oscar for best actor and permitted to give a 19-minute long speech.”</p><p>“But seriously, the academy has a crisis team in place. If anything unpredictable or violent happens during the ceremony, just do what you did last year. Nothing. Sit there and do absolutely nothing,” Kimmel joked.</p><p>The talk show host kicked off the 95th Academy Awards in a big way by parachuting onto the Dolby Theater stage “Top Gun” style.</p><p>He began by welcoming everyone to the 95th Oscars and dove right into cracking jokes at those in the audience including AMC star Nicole Kidman, saying that he was happy to see her “finally been released from that abandoned AMC.”</p><p>Kimmel also took a jab at Seth Rogen and Steven Spielberg, who worked together on “The Fabelmans,” which is Oscar-nominated tonight, and pointed out that Tom Cruise isn’t at the show tonight.</p><p>“If you are hoping to get a look at Tom Cruise, he’s not here. Or maybe he is here, maybe that’s Tom Cruise right there wearing a Judd Hirsch ‘Mission Impossible’ mask,” Kimmel said pointing to Judd Hirsch.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/abcnews.go.com/data:image/gif;base64><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZkpi7psPSZ56oZpOkunCTrHpmfK2cqcKzsY6loK%2BdXaq9pa3Tnqpop6OYrrO%2FjGtna2tdp7Kkrc9ooaKlna56rLXMppylZZuesKy%2FjKidn2WfqLCivtJmmp6qlaK8r8WMcm5xaGlsgHaLyJ10cm9nan53gJM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
