The songstress covered up slightly with a white shirt tied in the front. Jazmine completed her sexy outfit with a full-on glam makeup look, including vibrate pink eyeshadow, jet black eyelashes, and popping red lip color.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-16-at-6.41.22-PM-600x438.png><p>The post received over 98,000 likes and over 3,000 comments from fans who had plenty to say over the steamy photo, including one supporter who commented, “Lorddddddddd mineeee eyes has seeen yoooo gloryyyyy😂😂🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾😍😍😍.” Another person wrote, “I gotta unfollow you&nbsp;😩😩😩😩😩&nbsp;Before I say something inappropriate&nbsp;😍😍😍.”</p><p>A third fan commented, “Go head babygirl!! So proud of you and your beautiful azz!&nbsp;😍😍😘😘❤️.” “Foot on neck to all them hating heffas&nbsp;😘,” a fourth person wrote.</p><p>Jazmine’s sexy flick comes after the “Insecure” songstress had initially received <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>criticism</a> over her weight loss almost two weeks before. On Tuesday, Sept. 29, the Grammy Award winner appeared on her Instagram page much slimmer than most fans had remembered her. She posted a photo of herself wearing a form-fitting dress barefooted. Jazmine was at the set of her new music video shoot for her latest single, “Lost One.”&nbsp;&nbsp;She received several negative comments from folks who accused her of being too skinny. Shortly after, she responded to the critics on her Instagram story while also revealing her mother’s cancer battle.</p><p>The “Let It Burn” singer said that she had adopted a vegan diet lifestyle to support her mother. “I ain’t skinny and that was never my goal. My goal was to support my mother thru her battle w cancer by going vegan with her, and in turn it helped me as well. And I feel really good.”</p><p>The songstress’ post comes as she made her return to the spotlight after a two-year hiatus. “Lost One,” which Jazmine has been promoting, is her first single since her 2017 track “Insecure” with R&B singer Bryson Tiller. The song gained traction after being featured in the HBO show of the same name created by Issa Rae.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX9xe5BpZmpwX6XCtb%2BMnKaoo5mawG6wzrClZqKRr7qqusRmqq6knJ7DorqMrJynnKNis6K60magp6yfYq5ustGepbOxXZaztbHRZqqhnV2lvLTA0maqnrCpYrmqusaeqaKdXaW2pHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
