It’s certainly possible to take any wrestler in the game all the way to the top of the company or fantasy book your heart out, but when some of the best technical performers in the world (which includes names like Roderick Strong, Pete Dunne, Ricochet, Sami Zayn, Cesaro, Io Shirai, Johnny Gargano, Keith Lee, Kyle O’Reilly, and Tommaso Ciampa) are stuck with a rating somewhere in the low ‘80s, you’re ultimately left to wonder if the game is trying to punish certain fans/players for liking certain performers or even in-ring styles more advanced than “big move, taunt, repeat.” You have too many performers here who are being treated like second-class citizens for no apparent reason and too many performers who you’d probably only pick as a meme or because you’re desperate to see some kind of new matchup.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, it must be said that you can obviously create whatever character you want in <strong>WWE 2K22</strong> and even download pretty much any wrestler imaginable thanks to the talents of this game’s massive creative community. That’s obviously a big selling point, but it’s more than a little sad that players are more dependent on that feature than ever to access wrestlers who should have been in the game in the first place, gimmicks/designs that should have been in the game in the first place, or just to be able to enjoy more diverse and interesting overall collection of characters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8yoraKdXa%2B8r7GOsK6eZWKgf3N5x5qqZqeemnqwsoytn55lp6S%2FtMCMmqWdZaeatrOwxKyrZpuYlr%2Bir9OeqWaqn6jBpr7SZpyvnaJk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
