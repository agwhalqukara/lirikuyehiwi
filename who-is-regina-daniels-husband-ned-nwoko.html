He was born on December 21, 1960, into the Nwoko Royal Famly of Idumuje Ugboko Kingdom in Aniocha North Local Government Area of Delta State.</p><p>He was born Prince Chinedu Munir Nwoko and is about 40 years older than his wife, Regina Daniels (23 years old). In fact, he is about 15 years older than the actress’ mother, Rita Daniels, who was born on 12 July 1975 and is 48 years old.</p><p>Ned attended primary and secondary school in Nigeria before relocating to the United Kingdom, where he attended the University of Keele, Staffordshire. There, he obtained a degree in Law and History. He subsequently attended King’s College London to obtain an LLM in maritime and commercial law. He was later called to the English bar at Lincoln’s In.</p><h2><strong>Regina Daniels’ Husband was 58 When He Married the Actress</strong></h2><p>Ned Nwolo was 58 years old when he married Regina Daniels, who was at the time 19 years old. Ned is about 39 years old older than Regina and the age difference has led to controversies about their union.</p><p>Whatever the case, the couple married traditionally on May 26, 2019. The ceremony was held in Aniocha Local Government Area of Delta State. Prior to that, the couple held an introduction at Regina’s family compound in Asaba, Delta State. They met only three weeks before they started preparing for their marriage.</p><p>According to Ned, he doesn’t believe in dating for long since it will still end in marriage. There have been rumors that the couple met through Regina’s mother, Rita Daniels, who is 15 years younger than Ned.</p><p>However, both Ned and Regina denied the allegations. They claimed that they met, fell in love, and tied the knot as soon as they could. At the time the couple was married, Ned already had five other wives, making Regina his sixth wife. This raised eyebrows, and people were quick to point out the huge age difference.</p><p>Regardless, Regina had assured that she always knew that she was not going to marry someone her age because she is naturally stubborn and may not give a younger husband the respect he deserves.</p><h2><strong>Regina Daniels Wedding Pictures</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/my-images-696-×-392-px-2023-11-30T073022.655.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/my-images-696-×-392-px-2023-11-30T072652.716.jpg><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/my-images-696-×-392-px-2023-11-30T072311.447.jpg alt="Ned Nwoko" width=696 height=392 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>Regina and Ned Nwoko’s Children</strong></h2><p>While Ned has not less than eight children (one is late), his union with Regina Daniels has produced two sons.

The brothers’ birthdays coincide since they were both born on June 29 but in different years.</p><h2><strong>Some Controversies Surrounding Regina’s Marriage to Ned</strong></h2><p>There are controversies that hit the internet as a result of Ned Nwoko’s marriage to Regina Daniels. The first controversy was the age difference. Both Regina and Ned received backlash. Some internet users claim that the actress was too young for her husband. This brought a lot of debate, leading even famous people to have a take on the matter.</p><p>Former president of the Actors Guild of Nigeria, Ibanabo Fiberesima, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>supported Regina</a> and asked that the young actress’ choice of spouse should be respected.</p><h3><strong>Regina was Accused of Being Initiated into a Cult Due to Her Marriage to Ned</strong></h3><p>Following the wedding ceremony of Prince Ned and Regina Daniels, images of the actress dressed in white surfaced. It was quick for netizens to start querying the dressing.</p><p>The query led to accusations that Regina was initiated into a group for her being married to Nwoko. In the heat of the argument that took charge of many platforms and with different people giving different narratives, another story surfaced. This time, the claim was that the initiation was so that the actress would not be able to cheat on her older husband. If she did, there would be consequences.</p><p>Shortly after the rumor first started, <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>Regina Daniels</a> spoke about the initiation. She said that the ceremony was not an initiation but an act of welcoming to womanhood and becoming a part of an elite group of women of substance.</p><p>Before a woman can be a part of the group, she must be married and be a woman of substance. She revealed that even with the backlash following the “initiation,” she felt privileged to be a part of the group.</p><p>From all indications, she is not the only wife of Ned to have joined the group. Pictures of Ned’s other wife, Lina have surfaced, wearing similar white clothes as Regina.</p><h3><strong>Ned Allegedly Settled Regina Daniels’ Ex</strong></h3><p>This remains an unconfirmed but popular story.

The actress denied the allegation, attesting that she was not going to become anyone’s 7th wife.</p><p>The allegation went further that Regina’s mother, Rita, warned Chika to stay away from Ned or she would go spiritual with her.</p><p>Chika denied the claim and affirmed that she was not dating the billionaire and would not be anyone’s 7th wife. Even at that, there are individuals who assert that the actress may deny the claim, but she had an affair with Ned even before he married Regina.</p><p>In another report about Ned’s alleged new wife is Sara. In 2020, the media went abuzz with the claim that Ned was married to a UK-based White woman.</p><p>Regina responded to the allegation, denying that her husband did not add anther wife.
