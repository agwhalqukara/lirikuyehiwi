Thanks to the show’s success, Henson, often finds herself breaking&nbsp;into character while out spending time with her friends and family. As a result, fans are getting to know a few things about both Henson, and her character, and it appears that neither of them are willing to stand for any foolishness..&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are 5 Real Housewives Taraji P.

Like Leakes, Henson, has had to work very hard for everything she’s gotten. &nbsp;Although Henson has been acting since the late 90s, she hasn’t always received the roles or recognition she deserve.</p><p>(Photo by Jesse Grant/Getty Images for NBCUniversal)</p><h2>2.

Lisa Vanderpump</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/457131332.jpg alt="30th Annual AIDS Walk Los Angeles" width=642 height=537 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Henson is all &nbsp;about getting things done. &nbsp;Over the years, she could have easily walked away from acting due to a lack of opportunities; however, she chose to stick it out, and now she can enjoy the fruits of her&nbsp;labor. Lisa Vanderpump may have made a few enemies during her time on the show, but she’s also about making sure things get done according to plan.</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Alberto E.
