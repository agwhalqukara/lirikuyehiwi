They played through the previous game <a href=# rel=noopener>without several starters</a>. While that’s not an excuse to lose, the absence of so much talent can certainly sway the outcome.</p><p>Ivory spoke on why he likes the Kansas City Chiefs in this matchup.</p><p>"Although the Chiefs' 4-2 record doesn’t seem far off from 3-3, they're head and shoulders above the 49ers offense with the ability to explode at any given time to get points on board," he said.</p><p>"We must consider that the Chiefs may have just played the Super Bowl contending Buffalo Bills and played them well for most the game. As of Wednesday at 4 p.m. ET, <a href=# rel=noopener>83 percent</a> of the public money is on Kansas City, and I’m following suit. Give me Mahomes to pick apart the 49ers banged-up defense."</p><p>Edge-rusher Nick Bosa (groin), left tackle Trent Williams (ankle) and safety Jimmie Ward (hand) <a href=# rel=noopener>practiced</a> with limitations Wednesday, so the 49ers may see a few starters back on the field Sunday, but Moton explained why he made a clear-cut decision to back the Chiefs.</p><p>“With the highest-scoring offense, the Chiefs can run through healthy teams, let alone a squad with several key players questionable at best. Up against Kansas City’s fourth-ranked aerial attack, the 49ers won’t come within a field goal of knocking off the Chiefs with a nicked up defensive line.</p><p>“For the 49ers to have chance against the Chiefs, Nick Bosa and Arik Armstead must suit up to pressure quarterback Patrick Mahomes in the pocket. If one or both don't play, San Francisco would have to rely on a banged-up secondary that’s already without cornerback Emmanuel Moseley (torn ACL) to slow down a prolific offense.</p><p>“Lastly, Kansas City’s fourth-ranked run defense should fare well against head coach Kyle Shanahan’s ground attack, which is the bread and butter of his offense. Overall, this is a bad matchup for an injury-riddled 49ers squad. Chiefs win by a touchdown.”</p><p><b>Predictions</b></p><p>Davenport: Chiefs</p><p>Ivory: Chiefs</p><p>Knox: Chiefs</p><p>Moton: Chiefs</p><p>O’Donnell: Chiefs</p><p>Sobleski: Chiefs</p><p><b>Consensus</b>: Chiefs -2.5</p><p><b>Score Prediction: Chiefs 30, 49ers 24</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloZWeFeIOMm6OemZOdsrN50Z6nqKqkqHqmxM%2Beqa1lp5qyrHmWZqWfpF2ltqS30g%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
