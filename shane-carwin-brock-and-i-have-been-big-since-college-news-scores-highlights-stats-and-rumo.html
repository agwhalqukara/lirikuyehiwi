It's pretty clear that Carwin is shorter than&nbsp;his official UFC stats, which list him at&nbsp;6'5" and 265 lbs. Carwin lists his stats on his home website, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shane-Carwin.com</a>, as 6'2" and 265 lbs,&nbsp;and he weighed in at 259.5 at UFC 96, the last event he competed in.</p><p>Regardless, there is no debate that Carwin is a very big, muscular man, and he carries his weight well. He'll next face former UFC heavyweight champ <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Frank Mir</a> at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">UFC 111</a> on March 27 in a bout to establish the next heavyweight title challenger.&nbsp;</p><p>Mir&nbsp;has generated a lot of talk in recent months, with his ever-increasing weight and muscle development, and seems to be driven by the idea that in the heavyweight division at least, size matters.</p><p>Back at UFC 81, when Mir first faced current heavyweight champ, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brock Lesnar</a>, the 6'3" Mir weighed-in at a rather flabby 255. By <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">UFC 107</a>, a muscular and ripped Mir had to cut weight down to 264.5 lbs at the weigh-in before his first-round demolition of a much smaller <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheick Kongo</a>. Mir is arguably bigger now than Carwin, a transformation that many would have doubted was possible a year ago.</p><p>All of this begs the question: how much will Mir's increased strength and size help him against Carwin, who, until recently, was regarded as second only to Lesnar in size among UFC heavyweights? Carwin&nbsp;expressed some doubts&nbsp;as to how&nbsp;effective&nbsp;Mir's added bulk would be.</p><p>"Let's see how he carries it for 25 minutes," Carwin told MMABay.&nbsp;"Brock and I have been big since college.&nbsp;This is not an experience it is genetics and I know I can go 25 minutes full speed without fatigue from the extra weight.&nbsp;Also guys like Brock and I have been using our weight as a weapon and it takes a few years to master using your weight correctly."</p><p>Despite the fact that Carwin questions how much Mir's new-found size will help him in the short-term, he feels that his rival's decision to bulk up is generally a good idea. The UFC's heavyweight division is more competitive than ever, and every edge a fighter gets can help.</p><p>"I think Frank is making a good decision by putting on the weight, as I see the division getting bigger not smaller," Carwin stated. "I just don't see it as being the great equalizer that he does.&nbsp;If I was paying several hundred dollars a month to be my size I'd probably have to convince myself it is worth it.&nbsp;Only way we will know is when we meet up and see who is pushing who."</p><h3 class=streamElement><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/128098696039361740-5015982554575360948?l=ufc-mixed-martial-arts.blogspot.com" height=1 alt width=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoam5rYGx9br%2FHmqWeZZOWv7i1zWaZq6eToHqiusNmoGagkauybq7EnqVmmpmcerS1zZycZpufobmms8Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
