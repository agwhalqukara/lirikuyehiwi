Perhaps you’ve followed his career in the past and you think that you know him already. Perhaps you’ve never heard of him until just now. Perhaps you recognize his name vaguely and realize and understand that soon you’ll recognize him a lot more. No matter where you stand on the subject of the new television host, there are plenty of things you don’t know about this man. For example, did you know he’s a year younger than me and that actually kind of seems weird in a weird way? He’s not a huge name in Hollywood, yet, but he’s already halfway there thanks to his new role, and we have a few fun facts about <a href=#>Trevor Noah </a>you just didn’t know.</p><h2>He’s a Soap Star</h2><p>Back in the early 2000s, he was a major soap star in a South African soap opera, and that’s primarily where he made himself famous in his home country. He was only 18 when he landed the role.</p><h2>He’s Been a Radio Host</h2><p>He even hosted a few radio shows back in the day when he was in South Africa, and he gained quite the following there. So while he might not yet be too famous here, he’s very famous where he comes from.</p><h2>He’s Been on the Show Three Times</h2><p>It seems that he made quite the impression considering he’s only made three appearances on the show before he was given the job as a host, and that’s quite impressive. Three appearances is not a lot, but it seems that the people loved him.</p><h2>He’s Bilingual</h2><p>And by ‘bilingual’ we mean he speaks six languages fluently and is pretty good at two more, for a grand total of eight languages. Most people in America can barely speak their native English without murdering it in some way, shape or form. We are impressed.</p><h2>His Mother is a Former Inmate</h2><p>His mother is from South Africa and his father is of Swiss descent, and their relationship was illegal. After he was born, his mother was placed into jail for some time for her relationship with a man of his background.</p><p>Photo by Justin Barlow/Gallo Images/Getty Images for MTV</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGidoq6VYsGptc2gqmacmZm7tXnKp6awZaSnsre70WalqJmYZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
