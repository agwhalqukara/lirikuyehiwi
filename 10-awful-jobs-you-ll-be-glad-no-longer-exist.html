Back in the 19th century, the concept of organ donation and donating your body to science after passing was as far-fetched as you can get.</p><p>So what did medical students and faculty do at the time? They enlisted the help of a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">resurrectionist</a>. Also referred to as a body snatcher, resurrectionists stole dead bodies from graves and sold them to anyone that needed them.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-188728 alt="Resurrectionists At Work" width=800 height=973 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/resurrectionists-at-work.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-188728 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span></p><p>At the time, the only legal way to obtain a dead body was after a criminal execution, but they werenâ€™t held as frequently as was necessary to meet the supply demands of medical schools. The popularity of medical schools was increasing, and as more opened up, crime seemed to be decreasing at the time. As a result, the resurrectionist role was born.</p><p>For obvious reasons, resurrectionists mainly worked at night. They were able to get a nice chunk of money for their line of work, seeing as it was dangerous for both legal and spiritual reasons.</p><p>Legally speaking, stealing a dead body only constituted a misdemeanor. But religiously, it was a grave sin to dig up a dead body.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyiw8Wuo2ain5fAcII%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
