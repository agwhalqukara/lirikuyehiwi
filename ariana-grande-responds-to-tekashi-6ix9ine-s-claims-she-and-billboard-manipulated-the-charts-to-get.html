After all, how could her and Justin Bieber’s ‘Stuck with U’ collab be number one and not his ‘Gooba’ track?</p><p>The singer was quick to clap back at the rapper on social media, their beef only growing amid explosive back and forths.</p><p>As fans may know, Ari and Justin’s Stuck with U collab song debuted at the very top of the Billboard charts, right above Gooba, the song Tekashi dropped after getting released from prison.</p><p>He argued that Ari’s single had a massive last hour sales boost, accusing Billboard of manipulating the results.</p><p>She did not hesitate to shoot back and so did Justin at some point!</p><p>Ariana responded to the claims against her but did not mention the rapper’s name even though it was obvious she was talking about his accusations.</p><p>Judging by her response, she was also a bit confused as to why she, as a woman, was the only one being attacked by Tekashi despite the song in question being a collab with Justin Bieber.</p><p>The artist wrote: ‘I would like to address a few things which i don’t usually do (this has gone a bit too far)…my fans bought the song. JUSTIN’S fans also bought the song. OUR fans bought the song (never more than four copies each, AS THE RULES STATE). they’re ride or die motherf***ers and i thank god every day i have them in my life. not only when they fight for us to win but because they are some of the greatest people i know.’</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/tv/CAOO55HFAxS/</p><p>She went on to also say in part that: ‘sales count more than streams. you can not discredit that as hard as you try. to anybody that’s displeased with their placement on the chart or who’s spending time racking their brains thinking of as many ways as they can to discredit hard working women (and just the women for some reason…..), i ask you to take a moment to humble yourself. be grateful you are even here. that people want to listen to you at all.’</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CAV8BJJn4Y4/</p><p>In a video he later posted, the rapper complimented Ariana calling her ‘talented and beautiful.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>However, he also responded to her request to be more humble, arguing that it is not her place to say something like that to him since she will ‘never understand [his] pain.’</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeRp7aiusBmnquZnpmybr7ErKeoppSoerW7jK2cpJmjnbZugsixcKKmlah6pLjAoqSsZaOdsm6tzZ1km6Gcoa%2BwrdGdZKaZnp69trjArZydZaSdsm6vx5qpratdqbxus8StZJ2tlal6uLXToWSjraOptq95waKcm52iYq61edOhnGasn6V6dIWXbmxrZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
