The footage was shown <a href=#>during the funeral</a> of <strong>Bobby Brown</strong> and the late <strong>Whitney Houston’s</strong> daughter last month.</p><p>"The Houston estate asked if I would share this tribute that I put together for Bobbi Kristina's private funeral," Perry, 45, wrote. "On behalf of the Brown and Houston families, we would all like to thank you for your prayers and support. God bless."&nbsp;</p><p>The beautiful montage, titled "A Celebration of Our Princess," began with a quote from Bobbi Kristina. Houston’s 1996 song “You Were Loved” played in the background as the video featured photos of Bobbi Kristina throughout her life.</p><p>The Houston estate asked if I would share this tribute that I put together for Bobbi Kristina's private funeral. On behalf of the Brown and Houston families, we would all like to thank you for your prayers and support. God bless,</p><p>Posted by <a href=#>Tyler Perry</a> on Friday, September 4, 2015</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I hope you feel my love, pain, beauty, agony at times, blessings all the time. No one understands me,” Bobbi Kristina’s quote read. “And I don't expect them to, but I will try to spread my love and my story through words and this blessing of a powerful voice mom has given me."</p><p><a href=#>Bobbi Kristina was found</a> facedown and unconscious in her bathtub — just as her famous mother was over three years ago — on Jan. 31. She died at the age of 22 on July 26, after months of treatment in a medically induced coma. Her funeral service was held at Saint James United Methodist Church in Alpharetta, Ga., on Aug. 1. Days later, her boyfriend, Nick Gordon — who briefly went to rehab during her hospitalization — was accused in a new lawsuit of killing Bobbi Kristina with a “toxic cocktail.”</p><p>Watch the video above.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKuypJWnerGx0auwrGWmnrGmu4ytqaKapamybrLRqKRmmp%2BXr6p5yqugrKyZo65urtGorqerXZvCr7HRmqNmr5GpsKl5kWlobm1p</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
