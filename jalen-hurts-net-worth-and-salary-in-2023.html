The Philadelphia Eagles&nbsp;player recently signed a contract that placed him on an estimated $4.2 million yearly salary, a figure that has steadily increased since he began playing in 2020.</strong></p><p>All eyes have been on the quarterbacks since the NFC Championship games began. At first, it looked like Jalen popped out of nowhere, as he initially came on as a backup player. In no time, however, Jalen has proven himself worthy of a better position by leading an outstanding offense. The quarterback, who the Eagles selected as Carson Wentz’s backup, has gradually matured into one of the league’s most intriguing players. Here is a breakdown of what Jalen earns in the NFL.</p><h2><strong>Jalen Hurts’ Net Worth is 6 Million Dollars</strong></h2><p>Jalen Hurts’ estimated net worth is a whopping $6 million. Most of his earnings come from playing the position of quarterback for the Philadelphia Eagles. Even though he only turned pro in 2020, Hurts is poised to become a superstar in his own way.</p><p>The Philadelphia Eagles selected Jalen Hurts with the 53rd overall pick in the second round of the 2020 NFL draft. Even though he had a very promising record from the years of college football he played for the Alabama Crimson Tide football team, the Eagles signed him as a third-string quarterback. Ahead of him was Nate Sudfeld in the second string and Carson Wentz as the starting quarterback. He lasted only a short time in this position.</p><p>A few weeks after he came on, Hurts was elevated first to the second-string quarterback and then to starting quarterback after Wentz was benched for poor performance. Hurts has since exceeded many expectations and led his team to some notable victories. With his excellent performance, one would expect him to be cashing in the high stakes. Since he is still in the first career of his pro career, Jalen Hurts net worth is expected to exceed the $6 million it currently is.</p><h2><strong>What is Jalen Hurts’ Current Salary?</strong></h2><p>Hurts’ first rookie deal was worth a total value of $6,025,171 spread over four years. His yearly cash flow would be $1,157,744, with a basic average salary of $1,082,744 and a signing bonus of $485,486. He received a $75,000 workout incentive for each of the three seasons he has played, making him one of the most underappreciated athletes in the NFL.</p><p>To better put his salary in perspective, going by what he has received so far; in 2021, he made $883,871, and in 2022, he was paid $1,082,744. He also received a $75,000 exercise bonus. While this seems like a considerable amount, Jalen is underpaid, especially when compared with his other NFL colleagues. Take a look at the breakdown of his salary cap since he was signed:</p><ul><li><strong>2020: $610,000</strong></li><li><strong>2021: $883,000</strong></li><li><strong>2022: $1 million</strong></li><li><strong>2023: $4.2 million</strong></li></ul><h3><strong>How Did Jalen Start Playing Football?&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Jalen Hurt’s success as a football player has been in the making for many years. Since his father was a football coach who might have had a playing career, it’s easy to see how Jalen caught his love for the sport. He attended Channelview High School, where his dad was the coach.</p><p>Hurts was a sophomore Second-team All-District pick and a junior District 21-6A Overall MVP. He was a four-star recruit during his high school career and was regarded as one of the top dual-threat quarterbacks in his class. To his credit, he also competed in powerlifting, reaching the finals at the regional level in the 198-pound weight division. He didn’t make powerlifting a career or earn much money from it.</p><p>Texas A&M courted Jalen, but he chose the University of Alabama. He spent his first three college football seasons with the Crimson Tide, and in 2016, he won both the SEC Freshman and Offensive Player of the Year awards.</p><p>In 2017, Jalen’s Alabama team defeated the Clemson Tigers 35-31, winning him his first College Football National Championship. The following year in 2018, Jalen Hurts was voted the Sugar Bowl Offensive MVP for his play in the team’s 24-6 victory over Clemson. Jalen Hurts transferred to the University of Oklahoma for his last year of college eligibility, and as a graduate transfer, he was qualified to participate in the 2019 season.</p><h3><strong>Hurt Has Played for Only One NFL Club Since He Turned Pro</strong></h3><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external><img decoding=async fetchpriority=high src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/02/Hurts.jpg alt width=696 height=464 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>After college, Jalen was chosen for the First-team All-Big 12 team and awarded the Big 12 Offensive Newcomer of the Year award. He came in a few points behind&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>Joe Burrow</a>&nbsp;in the voting for the Heisman Trophy Award. Philadelphia Eagles made Jalen Hurts their second-round pick in the 2020 NFL Draft with the 53rd overall pick. He had initially been the team’s third-string quarterback but was swiftly promoted to second-string.</p><p>This meant he could be used in games as a lone quarterback or for quarterback running plays. Toward the end of Hurts’ rookie season in 2020, Carson Wentz’s performance deteriorated so much that he was benched and his position became open. Hurts then took over as the team’s starting quarterback.</p><p>As starting quarterback, Hurts has not disappointed. He guided the Eagles to the playoffs in 2022–2023. He was selected to the Second team of the All-Pro in 2022 and was also named to the Pro Bowl. He won the Bert Bell Award for all of his efforts.</p><p>Since his rookie contract is still on, Hurts has played for only one team since he turned pro. Considering how well he has done, he is looking at a more lucrative extension once his contract is up.</p><h2><strong>Does Jalen Hurts Have Other Sources of Income?</strong></h2><p>Because of the volatility of an athlete’s career, it is quite common for famous players to establish alternative sources of income. Many players typically retire in their mid-thirties, and a lack of understanding of financial matters has led many athletes to bankruptcy.</p><p>While Jalen has proven his brilliance on the court a million times, it is yet to be seen whether he has established any backup sources of income for himself away from football. Since his career is still in its early years, there is no doubt he will get endorsement deals to improve his worth soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZLeiuMSnZKGtoqnAbrrErWSwp6KptW6tzZ1krJmclr%2B6ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
