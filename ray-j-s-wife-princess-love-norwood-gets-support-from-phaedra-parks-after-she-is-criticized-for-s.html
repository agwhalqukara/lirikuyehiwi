The mom of two is working hard to get back her sexy body back in top shape, and some people find she is moving too fast.</p><p>Via social media, Ray J’s wife shared this photo with the following caption: “Getting that old thang back 💙.”</p><p>Phaedra Parks had this sweet compliment: “She fine She fine fine 🔥”</p><p>One critic lashed out by saying: “Not focusing on your children? You can’t have a childlike three days ago and so obsessed over a body. 🙄🙄🙄🙄 I guess it’s a Hollyweird thing.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B7uoHk4gvQD/</p><p>Princess Love hit back with: “Shut up.”</p><p>A defender stated: “You do you… Your body looks great… I have had ten children, and I am trying to get back before any kids… Work in progress 💖💖💖.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B7TgNu0glSS/</p><p>The critic came back to explain herself: “No one said she doesn’t look good; even a blind person can see that she’s beautiful. But it’s not normal how the pressure in Hollyweird makes women focus only on snapping back. Look at Draya after having given birth. She was in the gym after one day. Well, maybe to Americans it’s normal.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B7wMxjtg_ht/</p><p>This backer replied: “Right!! You have to be sure you are good… you are def focusing on tour kiddos and taking care of you… why do people come on your page and talk Chit????”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B7_qeQDAiVf/</p><p>The same critic continued: “Never said you said she doesn’t look good. Re-read my statement. My point was damn, can’t she look good for herself? Not everyone is doing things for other people or pleasing everyone, it’s not good to make assumptions. 🤷🏿‍♀️ Hater? You guys are Haters. I didn’t say anything, viciously. But women in Hollywood focus on snapping back ASAP. It’s pressure. Is she’s not pressured it’s okay? I can see that the princess is a gorgeous woman who does not have to feel insecure. As I already said, it’s an American thing. No hate here just concerned.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B7HgDu4AGcg/</p><p>A fan hit back with: “You are saying she doesn’t focus on her kids, and those are fighting words. Your pretty much saying she’s more worried about herself than her child’s needs, which is not for you to say & it’s rude as hell. She’s glowing & bouncing back, no need for the negativity or jealousy. Just plain rude.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Princess Love is a very compelling character.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeilsZuttJmrqKelWK9s7XNnJysq12hvLexjKemq6%2BfpLFus8StqmarpaW9sL7TZp2rp51ivamtxJ2pmmWglr%2Bsv4yana2domLAqbGMoqpmm6KewaqvyLOcnWWWpL9uv8eaqaKml2LBqbXSZqehp6SkerCyjKGcq2WgpMC1ecGambJlkqSxunmSb21uaGZk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
