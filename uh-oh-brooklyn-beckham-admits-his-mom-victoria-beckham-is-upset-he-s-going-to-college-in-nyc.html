So, it’s no surprise that the 43-year-old British fashion designer is now a bit “upset” that her son is leaving his home in UK to attend <a href=#>college in NYC</a> come fall.</p><p><a href=#>MORE: Victoria Beckham Reveals the Secret to Her Happy Marriage With David Beckham —&nbsp;“We Have a Lot of Fun!”</a></p><p>“I’m nervous, and my mom’s upset about me leaving. But it’s really exciting. I kind of live in the moment. I don’t think people in New York will annoy me, and I feel like when I go there, I’ll meet lifelong friends. Stuff like that,” Brooklyn, 18, told <a href=#>GQ magazine</a> in a new interview. Victoria and <a href=#>David Beckham</a>‘s eldest child is gearing up to study photography at a four-year university, though he’s not yet disclosed which school he’s specifically attending.</p><p><a href=#>https://www.instagram.com/p/BV29mmwDstb/</a></p><p>According to Brooklyn, it was his dad, David, 42, who gave him his first camera at just 14 years old. “I do backstage photography at my <a href=#>mom’s [fashion] shows</a>, and I mean, I love doing it — but my mom’s like, ‘Go take pictures of the models!’ and I’m a bit shy. So I kind of have to get the first two out of the way, and then I’m used to it,” he revealed.</p><p>Interestingly, Brooklyn isn’t the only Beckham kid to recently make headlines. Earlier this month, David and Victoria’s six-year-old daughter, <a href=#>Harper Beckham</a>, received the best gift ever when her soccer star dad <a href=#>built her a giant, Lego Disney castle</a>! “Page 1 of the Disney castle, 4,000 pieces, 490 pages of instructions, I look confused but I’m so excited,” David captioned a photo of himself unboxing the amazing project. Several hours later, the proud dad — who also has shares sons Romeo Beckham, 14, and Cruz Beckham, 12, with Victoria — returned to Instagram to post a snapshot of the finished product. “1am —&nbsp;done. Someone’s gonna have a nice surprise in the morning,” <a href=#>he wrote</a>.
